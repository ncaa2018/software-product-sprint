      <p> I am a sophomore at Pomona College studying 
          Computer Science and Africana Studies. I hail from a 
          Nigerian household in Houston, TX. I am passionate 
          about creating social structural changes that liberate and 
          benefit the livelihoods of everyone. I enjoy having 
          conversations about analyzing and understanding morality, 
          society, and humanity. I love playing/watching volleyball and 
          reading op-eds. Fav TV Shows include Black Mirror, Sherlock, Big
          Little Lies, and The Handmaid's Tale. </p>

      <p>I enjoy immersing myself in different cultures through traveling because 
      it exposes me to different philosophies, norms, and histories 
      beyond my personal experiences. It allows a space to question and compare the legitimacy of
       notions I've held through my perspective. Though I am a low-income student,
        I've been fortunate through the generosity of educational programs to travel to Peru, Cuba, and Rwanda. 
        Each experience challenged me worldview, made me ponder my place in the world, and understand the effects 
        of structures and history that stretch beyond arbitrary lines. </p>

     <p> My most recent trip abroad to Rwanda before my first-year in college. </p>
     <p><i> "Although “credo” means “I believe”, at this point I am not sure what to believe. 
I once stated in a Credo long ago “[Rwanda’s] strength and humility made me ponder—and even consider the greater ends forgiveness can impose on humanity.”
 My mind sees the practicality behind Gacaca—that it is perhaps the best method for a country eager to rebuild its communities and restore the relationships that was once the backbone of its culture and society. I can understand the reasoning behind the willingness to forgive—that it can give peace of mind and the space to be vulnerable for strength and growth. But my heart feels like forgiveness may not be enough to fill the gaps left empty in places that where once gatherings of love, eerie emptiness that quakes at the thought of memories, and a soul that was once full and filled with content for life and purpose.
But perhaps forgiveness may just be just a peace of mind and a piece of strength to move forward." - 8/10/18 </i></p>
